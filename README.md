## About
Simple game based on drag mechanic with random generated levels which was made by 2 days.

At this project i used generation by prefab,
argorithm just spawn random prefab from array.

For detect touch i've used EventSystem ["script here"](https://github.com/thewatcher39/theDot/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/BallController.cs "controller script"), also present basic slow motion mechanic.
